# Hello

Hi,
At 2023/12/11 09:00 (UTC+0), Binance will close usersâ€™ positions, conduct an automatic settlement and cancel all pending orders on the Asset BUSD cross margin pairs. If there are any outstanding cross margin loans denominated in any asset, any of the delisted assets held in your Cross Margin account may be sold. We will then delist these pairs from Cross Margin. Please note that users will not be able to update their positions during the delisting process, and they are strongly advised to close their positions and/or transfer their assets from their Margin Wallet to their Spot Wallet prior to the cessation of margin trading at 2023/12/11 09:00 (UTC+0). Binance will not be responsible for any potential losses.
